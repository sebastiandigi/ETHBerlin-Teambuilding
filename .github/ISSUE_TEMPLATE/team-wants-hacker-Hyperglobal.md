name: "Hyperglobal" wants hacker
about: I am entrepreneur seeking to hack journalism back on track

---

## Pitch

"Hyperglobal" is a new worldwide journalistic format built on the blockchain. Articles from global quality sources are translated via AI (hack: deepL) and finetuned by editors to your language. Readers pay per smart micropayments and can stake coins to challenge journalistic dilligence of articles to prevent fake news. 

## Team

I am an entrepreneur & journalist who has successfully lead a social business and recently built up Gapless (investor was Porsche) as a venture architect, an ethereum-based platform for classic cars (use case: vehicle ID). For Hyperglobal I am in concept phase, currently only working with one designer on it and sounding it with coders and entrepreneurs.  

## Skills wanted

For this hackathon, we should prioritize micropayments and challenging the journalistic dilligence. For this we need solidity coders with basic infastructure/ geth skills (those skills can be of course divided across several people). We can build on code that CIVIL has developed. (This project is planned to run on CIVIL at some point, too).
Second priority would be the flows and frontend, for which a UX/UI designer and a full stack developer would be premium!

Anybody else who is hyped by working on ad-free impact journalism - please join us! 

There are many ends to work on - I feel flexible about working on what suits our skill set most.
